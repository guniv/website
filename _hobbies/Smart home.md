[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) allows me to control smart lights, blinds, locks, thermostats, robot vacuums, and more. I use WiFi, [Zigbee](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), [Z-Wave](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js-ui/#/), and Bluetooth devices in my smart home. Some other highlights:

I use an antenna to read my home's water, gas, and electric utility meters to track my usage, along with some individual device power meters on specific devices (like uninterruptable power supplies and smart plugs). 

I also have a [Home Assistant Voice](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/) smart speaker to replace Google Home devices. My HA Voice uses a local text-to-speech and speech-to-text system to minimize reliance on the cloud.

In my smart home, I prioritize setting Home Assistant and devices up so that they don't need to communicate with the cloud and can work offline.
