I maintain four custom-built PCs at my home. 

My personal PC has an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor and a Nvidia RTX 3080 graphics card with 32GB of memory.

Another PC at home has an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processor and a Nvidia 3070TI graphics card with 32GB of memory.

A media center PC is an older system with an Intel i5-3570k processor and a Nvidia 1050ti graphics card with 16GB of memory. It is mainly used for streaming games.

The other PC is one of my home servers and has an Intel i5-14700K processor with Nvidia 1070 and Nvidia 980 graphics cards and 64GB of memory.

I also help friends with building their computers and have probably too many spare parts sitting around.
