I've been gaming since I was very young and it's still my favorite thing to do to relax. I play a lot of multiplayer games with friends and also enjoy singleplayer games. Some of my favorite games of all time are (in no particular order):

- Garry's Mod
- Overwatch 2
- Team Fortress 2
- Project Reality
- Mass Effect

It's very hard keeping track of everything I've played so the list above is not exhaustive.
