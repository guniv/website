title: My servers
description: I have two servers at my home running the Unraid operating system that I use to self-host a variety of apps and services. One of the systems is a storage server with 22 terabytes of storage, and the other is a simple mini PC.

Some highlights are:

- [Immich](https://immich.app/) - This works essentially like Google Photos, so I can store my photos on my server and get the same useful functionality without sharing my data with Google or paying subscription fees.
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) - This is my own personal streaming service. I have a Blu-ray player in my server that I can use to rip discs I purchase and then I can watch them using Jellyfin.
- [Paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) - This sorts and organizes my documents for me. I can quickly scan in a document in my printer, the printer sends it to the server, and Paperless-ngx sorts it.
- [Dawarich](https://dawarich.app/) - This replaced Google's location history for me, so now I have a nice way to visualize all of the travel I've done. When Google shut down their location history, I exported my data and imported it into Dawarich.
- [Frigate](https://frigate.video/) - This is a network video recorder that I use to manage my security cameras.
- [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) - This is a network-level adblocker that helps remove annoying ads on all of my devices, like phones and TVs.
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) - This is Mozilla's well-known email client, and I use it to sync and back up my emails so I can free up space on my Google account if needed without worrying about losing anything.
- [UptimeKuma](https://uptimekuma.org/) - This lets me monitor all of the services I run to make sure they stay up and don't have any issues.
- [Umami](https://umami.is/) - This is an analytics tool, like Google Analytics, that I use on this website to track visitors and clicks.
- [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) - This app lets me have a unified login experience for all of the services I run, so I don't have to remember tons of passwords.
- [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) - This is a locally hosted server for Bitwarden, so I get to utilize Bitwarden and my data stays on my server.
