# guniv.net

Yep. This is my website.

## How it works

### Building

The site gets built on GitHub Actions and is sent to GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Pages. It is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. At home I quickly iterate on the site by using a Docker container.

### Analytics

I use [Umami](https://umami.is/) analytics, self-hosted on my home server, to keep track of pageviews and other stats.
