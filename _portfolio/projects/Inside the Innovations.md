title: Inside the Innovations
description: I helped conceptualize and execute this social media campaign at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I made example posts to help visualize the format for the campaign, and also helped decide what the goal of the campaign should be. The campaign focused on highlighting lab staff who would not normally be showcased in other lab media. I personally interviewed five people for the project and put together the website and social media copy for all of the initial ten highlighted staff.
