title: Big Orange Robotics
description: I founded and ran this Robot in 3 Days team. I organized sponsorships, selected members and leaders for the team, helped develop our visual brand identity, and handled our relationships with other teams and the University of Tennessee. We had a very successful season and built an impressive robot with limited resources.
