title: CoolerControl-Docker
description: In March 2025, I developed and maintained a Docker container distribution of CoolerControl, an application that allows for fan control on Linux systems. It was downloaded more than 2,500 times. I built out processes to maintain the container automatically, maintain documentation for the container, and field support issues for users. My work demonstrated the interest in this to the official developers who launched their own official container in July 2025.
