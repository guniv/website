title: Social media cards A/B testing system 
description: I pitched and then implemented a system for the non-profit organization Global Business Coalition for Education that allows for the creation of multiple social media cards that all send the user to the same webpage, allowing GBC-Ed to re-share the same content without it appearing “stale.” It also allows for A/B testing to find the most effective card layout.

I used HTML redirect code to develop a system that allows for A/B testing of social media cards. This allows the organization to identify which card layouts/content are most effective, and allows the organization to “re-post” similar content without it appearing “stale” and over-used.

For example: 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/ab1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Original card variation.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/ab2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Card variation with different title and description, same image.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/ab3.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
