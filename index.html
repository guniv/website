In this role, I wrote for the Bulletin, the Laboratory’s internal news, about research and events. Lincoln Laboratory is a federally funded research and development center. As a member of the Bulletin’s small writing team, I proactively sought out story leads, asked insightful questions, and simplified complex technical language to highlight the work and achievements of Lincoln Laboratory and its people. Additionally, I managed important Bulletin projects, such as a website redesign, and served as the primary point of contact for technical issues.</p> <p>I also worked with the Global Business Coalition for Education (GBC-Ed), where I helped with social media and other communications content and strategy for this nonprofit. I played a vital role in crafting and scheduling impactful tweets and helped build the “welcome” series of emails, which introduced new subscribers to the company’s work and initiatives. My creative content strategy and execution helped drive over 2,000 event registrations and generated over 25,000 social media engagements through a mix of organic and paid content.</p> <p>In addition, I worked as a science writing intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), another federally funded research and development center. During my time at ORNL, I helped explain the lab’s complicated neutron scattering research to the public by crafting shorter story tips and longer feature pieces. Collaborating closely with a team of communication professionals, I contributed to both directorate-specific and laboratory-wide communication efforts.</p> <p>Outside of my professional work, I have also volunteered with robotics teams to practice my communications skills. I started by joining a team called the L&amp;N STEMpunks in high school and starting their media program. Later, I returned to mentor students on the team. At the University of Tennessee, I started a team called Big Orange Robotics, where we built a robot in 3 days to serve as an inspiration tool for high school teams. I’m passionate about using robotics as a learning and inspiration tool for K-12 students exploring careers in STEM, so I use my communications skills to help promote these programs.</p> <p>In 2019, I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a bachelor of science degree in communication, majoring in journalism and electronic media. With my diverse skill set and passion for communicating about science and technology, I am well-equipped to excel in a variety of roles in the fields of science writing, social media, and communications.</p> <hr> <div id="testimonial-carousel" class="carousel"> <div class="carousel-content"></div> </div> <div id="testimonial-arrows" class="carousel"> <div class="carousel-arrows"> <button id="prev-arrow" class="carousel-arrow">←</button> <button id="next-arrow" class="carousel-arrow">→</button> </div> </div> <script>

    { "quote": "Josh was an integral part of the weekly internal Bulletin at Lincoln Laboratory. When I first joined the team there was a lot to take in and Josh did a wonderful job at getting me up to speed and worked hard to try and integrate video content into the publication. He kept track of all of our stories and was good at leading the team through conversations and trouble shooting when necessary.", "author": "Riley Brunner, Video Content Producer, Jumo Health" },
    { "quote": "Josh has been a great addition to our digital communications and marketing firm, supporting social media and email marketing for a global education nonprofit client. He is a very strong written communicator who can translate complex ideas into digestible long-form and short-form content. In addition to his writing skills, Josh brings critical technical abilities to our digital work, frequently suggesting ways to do our work more effectively or efficiently. For example, he developed a system to route social media ad traffic sent to a third-party event registration site through our website to gather better performance data and control the look/feel of how the auto-populated previews appeared when shared on social networks. In my time working with Josh, I have also always been impressed with his quick responsiveness – especially since we have worked entirely remotely amid social distancing measures. Josh is a great team player that any company or organization would be lucky to have! DM me if you'd like to know more.", "author": "Jamie Lonie, Digital Media Marketing Specialist, Global Business Coalition for Education" },
    { "quote": "It was really a pleasure to work with Josh. He hit the ground running and was able to help us create successful new social media content and campaigns from the get go. His work made a huge difference at a time when all of us were very busy and he was very autonomous and able to suggest/ implement new creative ideas.", "author": "Francois Servranckx, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Communcications Lead, Guardian Life" },
    { "quote": "Josh was a science writing intern on my team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory during his senior year of college, 2018-2019. ORNL science writing internships are challenging and demanding, and Josh was equal to the task, proving to be a valuable contributor to the team and a talented writer. His area of focus was research underway at the Neutron Sciences Directorate, which is fascinating but quite difficult to learn and understand—let alone explain clearly in layman’s terms to readers who are not science educated. During his year here, several pieces Josh wrote were featured on the website of the US Department of Energy Office of Science, which is a significant accomplishment for an intern and a testament to his ability to clearly translate the science for broad audiences.", "author": "Wendy Hames, Senior Technical Editor, Oak Ridge National Laboratory" },
    { "quote": "Josh has an excellent ability to devise a vision for a team and then develop an action plan to see that vision enacted. Most people are either vision leaders OR vision enactors, but Josh is both. In their first year as a team, Big Orange Robotics, under Josh’s leadership, successfully completed a 72 hour build on time and on budget. The team also executed an aggressive outreach plan by bringing their robot to over ten schools in East Tennessee. The outreach was well received by the schools and had a significant and positive impact on the community. Josh’s initiative in establishing Big Orange Robotics and leading them to a successful first year will leave a lasting impact on both the team and the University of Tennessee even after he graduates.", "author": "Rachel Ellestad, Associate Dean for Student Success, University of Minnesota Duluth" },
    { "quote": "As a senior Science and Technology Writer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I had the pleasure of working with Josh in 2018-2019 while he was interning as a Science Writer for ORNL's Neutron Science Directorate. Time after time, Josh proved he is capable of turning some of the world's most advanced and complex science into feature stories and news releases that are easily understandable by the general public. He was also adept at helping develop marketing communications and social media content in support of our directorate’s outreach objectives. Josh is highly skilled at interviewing subjects to obtain information and quotes for his stories. His ability to put interviewees at ease while asking detailed and sometimes pointed questions is a testament to his highly developed interpersonal skills. He also accepts advice and direction well, and understands when to seek help, if needed, during the story development process. I can confidently recommend that anyone looking for a dedicated and experienced writer would do well to consider Josh Witt for the position.", "author": "Paul Boisvert, Senior Science Writer, Oak Ridge National Laboratory" },
    { "quote": "Josh has been an excellent communicator, organizer, and leader for two of the robotics teams I've been a part of: L&N STEMpunks and Big Orange Robotics. Working on the same leadership team as Josh has been a good experience both times, as he's always keeping up with things that I know I would have forgotten, such as weekly newsletters, announcement timing, and following up on conversations. Any organization Josh leads I'm confident will have great internal communication and delegation.", "author": "Ben Klein, Director of Engineering, Swiftly" },
    { "quote": "Josh is a skillful communicator and strong leader. I have volunteered as mentor alongside Josh for 3 years on a robotics team which meets year-round, often 5-7 days per week during competition season. Josh is highly organized, dedicated, business-minded, and exceptionally tech-savvy.
